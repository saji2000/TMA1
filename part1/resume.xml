    <description>
			Me and my Co-Founder began the work on a dating app in August 2019, we worked with a contractor to help us develop
			the app as I did not have enough confidence in myself to take charge of the whole project and hire talented people to
			help us along the way. The first version was released in February 2020 and it was a disaster, we continued to work with
			them until May 2021 which we have had enough with them. This time I took responsibility and assembled a team to
			finish this project, I have conducted extensive interviews and started holding meetings, doing code reviews every week
			and take an initiative and active role in my company. We currently have 5 employees that are back-end and front-end
			developers, UI/UX designers. We are very close to release our first production ready version on App Store and Google
			Play.
